		<h1>Strings Internationalization API for ColdFusion</h1>
		
		<h2>i18n in 30 Seconds</h2>
		<p>
			It's just that easy - time to get your hand dirty and sling some code. 
		</p>

		<h3>Strings Files</h3>
		<p>
			SI (strings internationalization) makes heavy use of files that are solely dedicated to
			defining the generally static strings of your application (more to come on that).  This concept of strings abstraction certainly
			isn't unique - in fact many other libraries and API's available in other languages do the same thing.  Many use the format of the tried and true
			properties files (*.properties).  CF SI implements a similar concept - but in the form of cusotm .strings files (*.strings).
		</p>
		
		<p>
			These .strings files are identical in format to a properties type declaration in that each line contains a strings configuration
			consisting of a key and a value.
		</p>
		
<pre>
my.string=Strings localization is awesome!
</pre>

		<p>
			There are four conventions to which you must adhere in order to create a valid strings configuration;
			<ol>
				<li>File must end with a .strings extension.</li>
				<li>File must be named in accordance with the locale it's meant to represent.</li>
				<li>While your strings files can be located in any directory you like, all strings files must exist in the same directory.</li>
				<li>
					Each strings file must declare the same number of strings with the same <strong>keys</strong>.  Values obviously differ from one supported language to the next.  You're
					likely to get runtime exceptions in your application if/when this rule is broken.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		
<pre>
en_US.strings OR
en.strings
</pre>

		<p>
			Both are valid strings file names.  Of course, your strings file can contain any amount of strings declarations
			as are necessary.  Also, this file can be located anywhere you like.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			CF SI also supports string parameterization.  This is accomplished by defining "variables" that exist within your
			string by simply surrounding them with curly-braces as such;
		</p>
	
<pre>
my.parameterized.string=Hello, your email address is {email}.
</pre>

		<p>
			The <strong>{email}</strong> portion of the string declaration represents a value that will be provided at runtime.  Providing
			that runtime variable is just as easy as declaring it - we'll get into that in the API sections.  For now all you need to know
			is that any one string can have as many variables as is required.
		</p>
		
		<a name="_core_interface_object_api" />
		<h3>Core Interface / Object API</h3>
		<p>
			Now that you've got your strings defined, it's time to make them available to your application.  The core CF SI API is provided in
			the form of two interfaces; <i>ILocalizedStrings</i> and <i>IStringsFactory</i>.		
		</p>
	
<strong>i18n.ILocalizedStrings</strong>
<pre>
interface {

	public string function getString(required string key, string locale);
	public void function addString(required string key, required string locale, required string value);
	public boolean function hasStrings();

}
</pre>

<strong>i18n.IStringsFactory</strong>
<pre>
interface {

	public LocalizedStrings function getStrings(required string directory, required string defaultLocale);

}
</pre>

		<p>
			Implementations of these interfaces are located in the i18n.impl package.  ILocalizedStrings provides the core API for working with strings in your
			application (aside from the custom tag - which we'll get into in a moment).  IStringsFactory provides a mechanism to easy retrieve a properly initialized instance of ILocalizedStrings.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Here's how to do exactly that!
		</p>
		
<pre>
import i18n.impl.*;
	
factory = new StringsFactory();
strings = factory.getStrings(directory=expandPath("\i18n\samples\strings"), defaultLocale="en");
</pre>

		<p>
			The resulting instance of ILocalizedStrings which is now represented in the "strings" variable is ready for you to use!
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong><br />
			Initializing an object instance implementing ILocalizedStrings should be required only once during the lifetime of your application - <strong>you should
			not reinitailize it by asking for an instance from the factory every time it's needed.  It should be treated as a singleton - proper caching
			should be considered to avoid unecessary overhead.</strong>			
		</p>
		
		<p>
			In the strings file section of this documentation, our en.strings file contained a key of "my.string" - here's how we request it;
		</p>

<pre>
&lt;cfoutput&gt;
#strings.getString(key="my.string", locale="en"))#
&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
</pre>

	<p>
		The "locale" argument we're passing in is entirely optional when working with the default locale as configured when asking for the strings instance from the factory.  Now when
		we want to grab the same string representing a different locale - we simply swap the locale value (assuming of course you have another locale configured for your app - such as ru.strings);
	</p>
	
<pre>
&lt;cfoutput&gt;
#strings.getString(key="my.string", locale="ru"))#
&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
</pre>

	<p>
		And we should get;
	</p>
	
<pre>
Strings localization is awesome!
</pre>
	
	<p>
		Asking for parameterized strings works in the same way - except we provide values as arguments for the configured variables.  Again, using our "my.parameterized.string" definition we
		discussed in the strings file section of the documentation, we ask for it like this;
	</p>
	
<pre>
&lt;cfoutput&gt;
#strings.getString(key="my.string", locale="en", email="youremail@yourdomain.com"))#
&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
</pre>
		
		<p>The results;</p>
		
<pre>
Hello, your email address is youremail@yourdomain.com.
</pre>

		<a name="_custom_tag_api" />
		<h3>Custom Tag API</h3>
		
		<p>
			The core interface API provides an easy to use mechanism to implement strings i18n in our application, but definitely isn't as friendly as you'd probably like when working
			with strings in a UI template.  Well CF SI also makes this easier by providing a simple custom tag for use in just those scenarios called "string".  It can be used in the following
			way;
		</p>
		
<pre>
&lt;cfimport taglib="/i18n/tags/" prefix="i18n" /&gt;

&lt;i18n:string key="my.string" locale="en" email="youremail@yourdomain.com" /&gt;
</pre>

		<p>
			Again, the "locale" attribute of this custom tag is entirey optional when working with the default locale.  Working with this tag requires a bit more plumbing in order to ensure
			its correct usage - <strong>An object implementing ILocalizedStrings must exist in the application scope under the key of "strings"</strong>;
		</p>
		
<pre>
if (!isDefined("application.strings")) {
	factory = new StringsFactory();
	application.strings = factory.getStrings(directory=expandPath("\i18n\samples\strings"), defaultLocale="en");
}

variables.strings = application.strings;
</pre>

		<p>
			You're done!  Now go on and save the world with your highly accessible multi-lingual killer app!
		</p>
